# Rocket News ðŸš€ 

RocketNews is a mobile news application that utilizes starbase API. 

##Original Goal
The idea of this project is to utilize the spaceship news API ( in the GitHub listed provided ) and create a simple news application. This will be a tabbed application, one for news articles, the second for history. Data persistence will be integrated by storing history of articles we are reading, or have read. I will track the progress of an article by utilizing the position of the scroll bar in relation to the size of the article pages height. The assessment recommends using some of apples including apis, I will be using the WebKit to actually display the articles and collect scrollbar data. MVVM will be the design pattern of this product. I've also decided to make the app support dark mode.
